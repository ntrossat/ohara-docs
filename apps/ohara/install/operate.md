# Operate

How to keep Ohara running: data, backups, updates, continuous deployment, and fixes for common problems.

## Data

All state lives in the data volume, mounted at `/data`. Nothing is kept in memory apart from caches, so the container can restart at any time.

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `ohara.db` | SQLite database: GitHub App credentials, the chosen docs repository, sign-in sessions, MCP clients and token hashes, cached access checks, stale flags, the last sync of each code repository, and the search index |
| `docs/` | The latest snapshot of the docs repository |

`ohara.db` holds the app's private key and users' GitHub tokens. Only the server reads it. Treat the volume as a secret.

## Back up and restore

Back up the volume. The docs themselves are in GitHub, so a lost volume only costs the setup and the sign-ins: start again with the setup page.

`docker compose down -v` deletes the volume and resets Ohara to the setup page.

## Update Ohara

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

The data volume is kept: settings, sessions, MCP sign-ins, and docs survive the update. On each start, Ohara downloads the docs again and checks every code repository's sync.

Instances created before some features need a change in the GitHub App's settings:

| Feature | Change |
|---|---|
| Proposals | Grant **Contents** and **Pull requests** write permissions, then accept them on the installation |
| Merging docs with code | Check **Pull request** under **Subscribe to events** |

## Images

Each push to `main` that passes CI publishes an image to the GitHub Container Registry, `ghcr.io/<owner>/ohara`:

| Tag | Points to |
|---|---|
| `main` | The latest commit on `main` |
| `sha-<commit>` | One commit |
| `<version>`, `<major>.<minor>`, `latest` | A `v*` release tag |

## Continuous deployment

The CD workflow (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`) can deploy each push to `main` that passes CI. It keeps your hosting details out of the code: set them in the repository's **Settings › Secrets and variables › Actions**.

| Setting | Kind | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `DEPLOY_COMMAND` | Variable | A shell script that deploys. It runs in a checkout of the commit, with `$IMAGE` set to the published image |
| `DEPLOY_TOKEN` | Secret | The credential the script needs, available as `$DEPLOY_TOKEN` |

Without `DEPLOY_COMMAND`, the workflow only publishes the image. For example, a host with a deploy hook:

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST "https://deploy.example.com/hooks/ohara?image=$IMAGE" -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEPLOY_TOKEN"
```

## Switch to another docs repository

The repository is chosen once, at setup. To point Ohara to another one:

1. Delete the GitHub App in GitHub, under **Settings › Developer settings › GitHub Apps** (for an organization, its settings).
2. Remove the data volume: `docker compose down -v`. This also signs everyone out and disconnects every coding assistant.
3. Start Ohara again and follow the setup.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| The website doesn't update after a merge | GitHub can't reach the webhook. Check that `OHARA_URL` is public, and look at **Recent Deliveries** in the app's settings on GitHub. Restarting Ohara also updates the docs |
| The API or MCP server answers "Ohara is not configured" | Setup didn't finish. Open `OHARA_URL` and complete it |
| Coding assistants can't sign in | MCP sign-in needs an `https://` address or `localhost`. Otherwise, send a GitHub token as `Authorization: Bearer` |
| A proposal fails with a permissions error | The app lacks write permissions. Grant **Contents** and **Pull requests** write in the app's settings, then accept them on the installation |
| A docs pull request didn't merge with the code | A file in it has a code owner, or branch protection refused the merge. Ohara leaves a comment on the pull request that explains which |
| A code repository's docs don't appear under `apps/` | The repository needs a `.ohara.yml`, the app must be installed on it, and a private code repository is never synced into a public docs repository. Ask a coding assistant to call `check_repository` for the reason |
| Someone still reads the docs after losing access | Access is checked again every 5 minutes, so it ends within 5 minutes |

Logs go to the container's output: `docker compose logs -f`.
